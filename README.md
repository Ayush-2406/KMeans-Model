# KMeans-Model
In this project we have to find the optimal clusters for the given iris dataset.We have used an elbow method to find the number of cluster for the given dataset.
By using that no.of cluster I have trained a KMeans Model and predicted the output.I also check the accuracy score of the model and finally represents the value graphically.
